Projects identified by groupId:artifactId :: ProjectId
Projects have Releases identified by ProjectId + version :: ReleaseId

Projects reference ReleaseIds and ProjectIds of other Projects
  - Only in certain places are ProjectIds acceptable in place of concrete ReleaseIds
    - Plugin references (deprecated): Missing version means a built-in meta-version resolution algorithm is used
      - In practice this is dangerous, since plugins may not be forward/backward compatible
      - Build may be irreproducible, since different plugin versions may produce slightly different output given a particular configuration (and potentially different defaults)
    - Dependencies with version ranges: Multiple ReleaseIds potentially matching / compatible
      - In practice, this is dangerous, since most projects that may specify this sort of dependency won't actually test vs. all versions in the range
      - Build may be irreproducible, since range may resolve to another version in another environment/timeframe.

Releases contain Artifacts with different types, classifiers :: ArtifactId (ReleaseId + type,classifier)

Project Parent is a reference to another Release (ReleaseId)
